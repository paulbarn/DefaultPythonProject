Python Application Development Guide

November 2022

VS Code:
Install VS Code (Visual Studio Code) - Not Visual Studio!


Python:
Install Python from www.python.org
Version:
  32 bit - More compatible for many users, ODBC drivers for Aspen are default 32bit
	64 bit - Only issue is that you will need 64 bit ODBC drivers whcih are on ODC File Server
	3.10.x - Good Choice, don't install the absolute latest version due to packages not all available yet
	Anaconda - Also a good choice but virtual environment is different
	
	
Install:
	Maker sure to install in your User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python, NOT C:\ProgramFiles!
	Add Python path to your user Path Variable
		Path: Add C:\Users\pbarnett\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts - First line
		Path: Add C:\Users\pbarnett\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310			- Second line


Virtual Environments:
VENV Package:
	This is included in the base Python install
		REM Make the venv & activate it
		python -m venv venv
		venv\scripts\activate
	Activate:   venv\scripts\activate.bat
	Deactivate: venv\scripts\deactivate.bat


Managing Packages:
Use pip (which is pip3 when on Python 3)
		# list packages
		pip list
		
		# update pip
		python -m pip install --upgrade pip
		
		# install packages
		pip install wheel
		pip install pypdf2 pandas numpy cx-freeze
		
		# create requirements.txt
		pip freeze > requirements.txt
				
		# install from requirements.txt
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		
		# uninstall packages
		pip unistall pypdf2
		
GIT:
Clone a GITHUB Repository to Local Directory:
	Open a CMD Window by typing run cmd in the Windows "Type here to seach" 
	Navigate to the base directory, a new directory will be created - so don't make one here
		cd Drag the file path from the File Explorer into the CMD window
		git clone https://github.com/paulbarn/PdfParser.git
		Close the CMD window
	Right click on the new directory and select 'Open with Code'
	Open a terminal
	At this point you have a working copy of the repository and no GIT commands are required to run it

Make a GITHUB Repo from Local Directory:
1. Clone someone's repo on Github & copy local existing files into it, add files to it
		Web browser to github.com
		Login (or register an account)
		Copy the code link: https://github.com/paulbarn/DefaultPythonProject.git
		Create a Local folder
		Open a CMD Window
		git clone https://github.com/paulbarn/DefaultPythonProject.git .
		 or
		git clone https://github.com/paulbarn/DefaultPythonProject.git NewProject
		git remote -v
		git remote remove origin
		Now you simply have a copy of the repo on you local machine and are not tied to the source repo
		  because you odn't want to sync this with the source, likely you don't have permission anyway
		Copy files into this directory or start making files
		git add --all
		git commit -m "initial commit'
		To create your own repo on Github and push this code to it see the next section
		
2. Make Local repo & push to your Github
		TBD


Commands:
	git status
	git add --all
	git commit -m "message"

	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph -n 20

	git branch --list
	git branch name
	git branch -d name
	git branch -D name
	git branch -m name
	git branch -a
	git checkout branchname
	
	git fetch
	git pull
	git push

	git remote
	git remote -v
	git remote remove origin	
	
.gitignore File:
	venv/						# direcotries
	setup/
	old_code/
	build/
	app/setup.txt		# files
	*.csv						# pattern files


Publish:
Build for Distribution:
	Use pip install cx-freeze
	python setup.py build
	setup.py file contains the exe build instructions
	Output folder is build\...
	app.ico is an icon file - a 16x16 color bitmap image
		To make one use Word, import an image or symbol
		Make changes as desired
		Right click on image, click save as --> .png (usually 96x96)
		Use a web app/service to convert to 16x16 icon file and download the .ico file
		Example: https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-ico
	
    
readme.md
This file is in markdown language which is a lightweight HTML type of text file
It allows for formatting instructions with the text
Git uses these mostly but 
VS Code can show them with the CTRL-SHIFT-v (right click, open preview)
