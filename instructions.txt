Python Application Development Guide

November 2022

VS Code:
Install VS Code (Visual Studio Code) - Not Visual Studio!


Python:
Install Python from www.python.org
Version:
  32 bit - More compatible for many users, ODBC drivers for Aspen are default 32bit
	64 bit - Only issue is that you will need 64 bit ODBC drivers whcih are on ODC File Server
	3.10.x - Good Choice, don't install the absolute latest version due to packages not all available yet
	Anaconda - Also a good choice but virtual environment is different
	
	
Install:
	Maker sure to install in your User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python, NOT C:\ProgramFiles!
	Add Python path to your user Path Variable
		Path: Add C:\Users\pbarnett\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts - First line
		Path: Add C:\Users\pbarnett\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310					- Second line


Virtual Environments:
VENV Package:
	This is included in the base Python install
		REM Make the venv & activate it
		python -m venv venv
		venv\scripts\activate
	Activate:   venv\scripts\activate.bat
	Deactivate: venv\scripts\deactivate.bat


Managing Packages:
Use pip (which is pip3 when on Python 3)
		# list packages
		pip list
		
		# update pip
		python -m pip install --upgrade pip
		
		# install packages
		pip install wheel
		pip install pypdf2 pandas numpy cx-freeze
		
		# create requirements.txt
		pip freeze > requirements.txt
				
		# install from requirements.txt
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		
		# uninstall packages
		pip unistall pypdf2
		
GIT:
Create a git repo in a directory in the current directory
	Open a CMD Window by typing run cmd in the Windows "Type here to seach" 
	Navigate to the base directory, a new directory will be created - so don't make one here
		cd Drag the file path from the File Explorer into the CMD window
		git clone https://github.com/paulbarn/PdfParser.git
		Close the CMD window
	Right click on the new directory and select 'Open with Code'
	Open a terminal
	At this point you have a working copy of the repository and no GIT commands are required to run it
Commands:
	git status
	git add --all
	git commit -m "message"

	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
	git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph -n 20

	git branch --list
	git branch name
	git branch -d name
	git branch -D name
	git branch -m name
	git branch -a
	git checkout branchname
	
	git fetch
	git pull
	git push

	git remote
	git remote -v
	git remote remove origin	
	
.gitignore File:
	venv/						# direcotries
	setup/
	old_code/
	build/
	app/setup.txt		# files
	*.csv						# pattern files


Publish:
Build for Distribution:
	Use pip install cx-freeze
	python setup.py build
	setup.py file contains the exe build instructions
	Output folder is build\...
	app.ico is an icon file - a 16x16 color bitmap image
		To make one use Word, import an image or symbol
		Make changes as desired
		Right click on image, click save as --> .png (usually 96x96)
		Use a web app/service to convert to 16x16 icon file and download the .ico file
		Example: https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-ico
	
readme.md
This file is in markdown language which is a lightweight HTML type of text file
It allows for formatting instructions with the text
Git uses these mostly but 
VS Code can show them with the CTRL-SHIFT-v (right click, open preview)
